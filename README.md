# Delicias De Mami Anita

My name is Kevin Fajardo, and I created this website to support my grandma's small dining business because I truly believe her cooking is among the best in Connecticut. She not only prepares some of the most traditional Ecuadorian dishes, but she also serves them with the warmth and care of family—pouring love and dedication into everything she makes.

The website features various menu categories, including Main Dishes, Appetizers, Drinks, Kid’s Menu, and Desserts. Clicking on any category will navigate you to its respective section. Selecting "View More" will display the price along with a brief description of the dish.
